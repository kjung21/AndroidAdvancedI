# Clipping

## What is overdraw and why should you minimize it?

- Overdraw: When a pixel on the screen (for the current frame) is drawn more than once. 
- When it comes to drawing, every little bit matters for performance 
  - as you have less than 16ms to draw each screen. 
- While the Android system does a lot to optimize drawing, there is a lot you can do! 
- One thing is to be efficient about drawing.

## Define clipping.

- Clipping is a method for defining regions of an image, canvas, 
  - or bitmap that are selectively drawn or not drawn onto the screen.

## What's a real-life example of clipping?

- Camera clips your field of view.
- Your field of view clips reality.
